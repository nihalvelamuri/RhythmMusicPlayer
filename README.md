This Python code represents a simple music player application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library and audio playback functionality using the Pygame library. Here's a brief description of the code:

******MAKE SURE YOU ADD YOUR PATH LINKS WHEREVER NEEDED!!!!!!*****


1. **GUI Layout**:
   - The code creates a Tkinter window (main application window) with the title "Rhythm Music Player."
   - It defines various UI elements such as buttons, labels, and a Listbox to display the list of songs.

2. **Audio Playback**:
   - The Pygame library is used for audio playback, initialized with `mixer.init()`.
   - The Play, Pause, Stop, Resume, Previous, and Next buttons are provided to control audio playback.
   - Users can click on songs in the list to play them.

3. **Song List**:
   - The Listbox widget (`songs_list`) displays the list of songs with a black background and white text.
   - Songs can be selected from this list for playback.

4. **Display Size Customization**:
   - Users can customize the display size of the song list using the "Enter Height" and "Enter Width" fields and the "Update Display Size" button.

5. **Menu Bar**:
   - The application includes a menu bar with two options: "Add songs" and "Delete song."
   - "Add songs" allows users to select and add multiple MP3 songs to the playlist.
   - "Delete song" allows users to remove a selected song from the playlist.

6. **Event Handling**:
   - Clicking on a song in the list activates it for playback.
   - Buttons like Play, Pause, Stop, Resume, Previous, and Next are associated with respective functions to control audio playback.
   - The "Add songs" and "Delete song" options in the menu bar trigger the corresponding functions to add songs to the playlist and delete selected songs.

7. **Default Values**:
   - Default height and width values for the song list display are provided.

8. **Font and Styling**:
   - Fonts and styling are applied to the UI elements, such as labels and buttons, for better visual presentation.

Overall, this code creates a basic music player application with a user-friendly interface that allows users to add songs to a playlist, customize the display size, and control audio playback. It provides essential functionalities for playing and managing a list of MP3 songs.
